# Change rational

## Use NPM

angular.js is included as a regular file. Given this is a complex libary, I prefer using npm to 
manage this package. It makes upgrade simpler. 
NPM is already in use so I have no problem in using it to manage dependencies. 

## CSS

# Avoid child selector?

# Get rid of px and replace with REM, EM, etc 

# Responsive

# shorter selectors

# Avoid using IDs. They decrease portability.

# inline styles debate, separation of concerns, meh

# combine elements

# shorthand properties

# use Sass or postcss - validate, pre-process

## folder structure
I prefer to group things by feature rather than by type. 

## Use Webpack/requirejs
